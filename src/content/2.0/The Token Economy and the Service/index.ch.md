# The Token Economy and the Service
What makes ArcBlock unique is that it’s not just a set of APIs or libraries—it’s a robust platform with a full set of features. In addition, the service runs on top of its own native token system, which is driven by latest blockchain technology. 

## The ArcBlock Token (ARC)
The ArcBlock Token (ARC) is native to the ArcBlock platform. To achieve high-performance transactions, we built an optimized blockchain dedicated to ArcBlock’s own token services and the public ledger. The design goal is to achieve >100,000 Tx/s, which is more than adequate for a wide range of applications. In the future this blockchain could be improved for broader purposes.

The ARC is designed as a general purpose token that can be used in different scenarios.  Within ArcBlock, the ARC’s basic utility value is to pay for the cost of using the ArcBlock system.  Like a cloud computing service, the ARC is a utility token for paying the cost associated with using the service. 

Unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, where users typically pay a fee for each transaction they make, ArcBlock is designed to let application providers pay the transaction fees for their end users. This approach vastly improves the user experience. Developers pay on a monthly basis, enabling them to add up small units and save money.  ArcBlock also request developers to lock in a number of ARC token as a stake when they need to provide mission critical services. 

ArcBlock tokens map to ERC20 tokens 1:1. This simplifies token exchanges and allows developers to tie into the Ethereum community. Application developers can take advantage of the existing ecosystem built on the ERC20 token while also leveraging a high-performance and full-featured token service. While this mapping is necessary today, we anticipate that it may become obsolete as the ARC matures and the ArcBlock community grows.

## The Miners 
ArcBlock allow contributors (“miners”) to run ArcBlock platform services and join the overall service network. The role of miners within the ArcBlock community is significantly different from that of Bitcoin and Ethereum contributors, however.

### Resource Miners
Resource Miners contribute computing resources to the system. They might provide cloud computing resources and run as a cloud node, or contribute self-hosted computing resources. 

In ArcBlock’s design, Miners may provide the computing resources for their own use only, share them across multiple parties, or share them with anyone. The choice of model is entirely up to the miner, and can be changed as they need to.

### Component Miners
Component Miners contribute software components to the system, such as  new Chain Adapters, Blocklet Components, or ready-to-deploy applications. The component might be packaged code that can be reused and deployed by another application, or a set of services that's merely exposed through the Blocklet interface. For example, a deep learning-based image recognition service may have its own services running elsewhere, but offer the services as Blocklets so that other ArcBlock applications can use them. 

A smart contract defines how the miner’s fee will be distributed if the component is developed by multiple parties. It will also define the rules for how the code for the component is forked. 

## The ArcBlock Marketplace
The ArcBlock Marketplace is a decentralized blockchain application built on ArcBlock platform itself. The app serves as a marketplace for listing, searching, evaluating, using, and ranking reusable components, such as Chain Adapters, Blocklets Components, and applications. 

The marketplace is also responsible for maintaining public feedback about the quality of components and the reputation of their developers, as well as other information. This information will help users evaluate reusable components. All the marketplace information are recorded in the public ledger powered by ArcBlock’s blockchain technology to ensure transparency and the trust. 

## Token Foundation Services
The platform’s token foundation services consist of a set of Blocklet components that lay the groundwork for ArcBlock’s token services. 

The ArcBlock token is implemented entirely with Blocklet. The token foundation service is also powered by Blocklets, and the Token Economy Service consists of a group of Blocklet Building Blocks. Application developers can use Blocklet to easily handle events triggered by tokens and accomplish complex business logic. The distributed ledger in ArcBlock ensures that your tokens are secure, high performing, and reliable. 

Just like any other Blocklet components, the Blocklets for the token foundation service can also be improved and extended by the blockchain community . 

## Application Tokens 
With ArcBlock, developers can also create their own custom tokens that inherit all of the features of our native token. 

ArcBlock makes it easy to build your own economy. Tokens aren’t just for cryptocurrencies, however. They can represent many different things, from user identities, certifications, and documents to real-world entities. ArcBlock enables you to tokenize everything in your application.  

In the near future, you'll be able to make initial coin offers (ICOs) with ArcBlock’s application token once you've built and deployed your applications with ArcBlock.
