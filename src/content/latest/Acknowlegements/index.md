# Acknowledgements

This work is the cumulative effort of multiple individuals with the ArcBlock team, and would not have been possible without the help, comments and review from our partners, advisors, community collaborators and valuable customers.

During the authoring process we received valuable helps and comments from the rest of ArcBlock engineering and marketing team, our partners, we also received lots of valuable feedback from the emails, WeChat groups, Telegram groups, conferences and forums.
