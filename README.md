# ArcBlock Whitepaper

This is the repo for ArcBlock's technical whitepaper. The repo itself is a Hugo site, and it will build a web version whitepaper for easy browsing, searching and editing from a web browser.

This is a "keep up to date version" whitepaper, we will keep updating to make sure what's in the whitepaper is matching what we are doing. To keep highly competitive in the dynamic blockchain technology marketing, we may make changes from time to time, we want to make sure all changes are clearly documented in the whitepaper.

**The PDF version published during Token Sale Event live under `/src/content/ico` folder, they are the exact same version we published earlier. **
